This is if you need to add a tag to multiple volumes or instances.  This is setup to user your API access key.  It will prompt you at the beginning, create the session and after the script runs it will clear it so it will not be stored afterwards.  

The wild card filter queries every EC2 tag value in the entire region.  This is most useful if you use an organized naming convention already (if not, it may be a good time to start).

If will prompt you for the key-value pair, and whether to tag an instance or a volume.
